## 1. BUILD ARGS
# These allow changing the produced image by passing different build args to adjust
# the source from which your image is built.
# Build args can be provided on the commandline when building locally with:
#   podman build -f Containerfile --build-arg FEDORA_VERSION=40 -t local-image

### 2. SOURCE IMAGE
## this is a standard Containerfile FROM using the build ARGs above to select the right upstream image
FROM quay.io/fedora/fedora-silverblue:latest


### 3. MODIFICATIONS
## make modifications desired in your image and install packages by modifying the build.sh script
## the following RUN directive does all the things required to run "build.sh" as recommended.

COPY build.sh /tmp/build.sh

RUN mkdir -p /var/lib/alternatives && \
    /tmp/build.sh && \
    ostree container commit
## NOTES:
# - /var/lib/alternatives is required to prevent failure with some RPM installs
# - All RUN commands must end with ostree container commit
#   see: https://coreos.github.io/rpm-ostree/container/#using-ostree-container-commit
